Today I saw a post on LinkedIn by Kyle Coleman. I really appreciate the specific example given to demonstrate the idea. It reminds me a lot of The Mom Test by Fitspatrick which I've gone through a few times. I have to say narrowing it to one response that I dread makes this even more helpful given I am currently procrastinating on reaching out to potential customers for fear of this response.

I hope this is okay to link word for word on my blog. Perhaps I should reach out to ask him in and employ the post's said strategy.

My take on how to handle the dreaded “𝑰'𝒎 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒅” objection:

🐢 I’m the turtle for playing the long game.
🏆 The prospect is the trophy.

———

I caught someone on a cold call, and got through a quick:

🐢 “The reason for my call is…” + value prop.

Only to receive this common response:

🏆 “𝑰'𝒎 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒅.”

[pause a beat]

🐢 “What are you interested in right now?”

🏆 “I’m totally heads down building a Salesforce dashboard for my execs.”

[Aha, he’s not ‘𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒅,’ he just doesn’t have time]

🐢 “Oh man, thanks for taking my call. I’ll leave you to it, good luck.”

🏆 “Oh. Thanks.”

———

🐢 Immediate follow up email thanked him again for his time, and linked to a piece of Salesforce’s content around dashboard building.

2 Days Later: [🐢 email] Sent a blog on SFDC metrics execs care about.

3 More Days: [🐢 email] “A good friend of mine is an SE at SFDC, let us know if we can help.”

Next Day: 🏆 submits demo request form.

———

I call him, talk for 10 minutes, we give a demo all about the shortcomings of SFDC reporting & introduce our better solution.

🐢 Cold call. Manual drip. Meeting. Trial. Customer.
